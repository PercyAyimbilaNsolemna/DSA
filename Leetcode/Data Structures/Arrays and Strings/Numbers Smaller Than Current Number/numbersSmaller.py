    1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
    Easy


    Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. 
    That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

    Return the answer in an array.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
    Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
    Explanation: 
    For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
    For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
    For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
    For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
    For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
    Output: [2,1,0,3]
    Example 3:

    Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
    Output: [0,0,0,0]
    

    Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 500
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100

    
    O(NÂ²) Brute Force solution
