    Implementation of Queues in python using Linked List

    Operations: enqueue, dequeue, top, and size

    With their respective time and space complexity

#Creates a class node which will be used to create nodes in the linked lst
class Node():
    def __init__(self, data, ref=None):
        self.data = data
        self.ref = ref

#Creates a class to be used to create the queue
class Queue():
    def __init__(self):
        #Sets the head of the queue to none
        self.head = None
